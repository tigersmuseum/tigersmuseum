The Museum of the Royal Hampshire Regiment tells the story of the county infantry regiment for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

It traces its history back to 1702 when it was formed as Meredith’s Own, until its amalgamation with the Queen’s Regiment in 1992 to form the Princess of Wales’s Royal Regiment (Queens and Royal Hampshires).
